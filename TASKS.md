## Ideas to explore:
* Safe errors:
  * To ensure no data is leaked through exceptions exception types should not allow
    plaintext message. They message should be generated by the error based on structured data.
    Data can be marked with a `Sensitive` type class instance and the error constructors can use `using Not[Sensitve]` constraints
